# Motion-detection-system-using-computer-vision
"Motion Detection using Python with OpenCV" involves implementing a 
computer vision application that can detect motion in a video stream using Python 
programming language and OpenCV library. The application uses techniques such as 
background subtraction, thresholding, and contour detection to identify regions of the video 
where motion occurs. The project also includes functionality for drawing bounding boxes 
around the detected motion regions and saving the resulting video with motion annotations. 
The project can be used in various real-world applications such as security systems, traffic 
monitoring, and object tracking. The implementation of the project provides a basic 
understanding of computer vision concepts and how they can be applied to solve practical 
problems using Python and OpenCV
